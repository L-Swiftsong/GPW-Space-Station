  LogText: 'There seems to have been some security breaches, I''m sure they are just
    bugs in the system but the voice lockdown system has been triggering more often.


    The
    system should let us know if there is an intruder, but how could there be, we
    are in the middle of space, it''s probably just a bug...

    I''ll let Lexy
    know so she can fix it.
