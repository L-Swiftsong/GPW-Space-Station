  LogText: 'Due to a recent accident, the only escape pod had been greatly damaged
    and will need a few repairs. Lexy said she would fix it by wednesday, but with
    all the bugs in the system she''s already dealing with I doubt she could even
    attempt to start by then.


    They''ve got all the parts in engineering to
    get it started though.

    I hope there isnt an accident before then as the
    Escape Pod is the only safe way off this station.
