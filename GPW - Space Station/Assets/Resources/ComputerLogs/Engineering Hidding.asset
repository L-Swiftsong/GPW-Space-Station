  LogName: I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO - 20/04/2073-14:28
  LogText: I was doing my daily tasks when I saw IT, well I didnt see it until it
    was right next us and attcked Daniel, I dont think he made it. I dont know what
    that THING is but it must have been invicible of something. I'm lucky I ran to
    this storage room and hid under the table, it almost got me but a bright flickering
    light seemed to startle it, it was like it was harmed by the light - Keira
