  LogText: I can not believe that security man that has me on a wild goose chase
    to find the security key, I might just give up. I dont want to go to the crew
    area any more, I might try find a free bed in medical. The crew area has been
    freaking me our recently, I feel as though when I look out to the big openness
    of space something is looking back at me, I think im just getting paranoid but
    i can feel something watching me - Cat
