  LogText: 'That cheeky security man has been stealing my batteries and leaving them
    about the space station. There was thousands, I don''t understand how he has
    the time for any of that, he must not be doing his job properly. I have collected
    most of them however, I fear there are still a few still scattered around - Lewis '
