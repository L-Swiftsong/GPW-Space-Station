  LogName: The Boredome - 17/04/2073-23:15
  LogText: I have gotton very bored on the late shift in this storage room, its late
    and no one is coming through here so ive gotten a bit creative (and annoying)
    with my boredome and hidden the key to the crew area, I've also changed all the
    codes to the number keypads and hidden the codes in the lockers. I know comander
    Ryan would kill me is he finds out but hes still in recovery from his surgery,
    so I wont get in trouble for a while - Thomas
