  LogName: Looking for Lexy - 19/04/2073-21:05
  LogText: 'I was going to ask for an update on the Escape Pod''s repairs, but I
    couldn''t find Lexy anywhere.


    Last anyone saw of her she was trying to
    fix an issue with the voice authentication being too lax, but she had apparently
    gotten distracted by something again.


    That''s my shift done though. I''ll
    look for her again tomorrow.
