  LogName: Escape Pod Log - 11/04/2073 -09:56
  LogText: Due to a recent accident, the only escape pod had been greatly damaged
    and will need a few repairs. The engineers said they would fix it be by wednesday
    but I doubt they will even attempt to start by then, they have all the parts
    in engineering to get it started. I hope there isnt an accident before then that
    means we would need to use the escape pod - Olivia
